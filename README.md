# FastAPI Chatbot Backend

This is the backend API for a chatbot built using FastAPI and OpenAI's GPT-4. The API allows interaction with the chatbot by submitting text-based queries and receiving generated responses.

### Features
- **FastAPI** backend
- **OpenAI's GPT-4** model integration
- A simple prompt template to ensure concise, helpful, and safe responses
- **CORS** enabled for frontend integration
- **Swagger** UI support for API testing

### Requirements
Ensure you have the following tools installed on your local machine:
- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package installer)
- FastAPI framework
- Uvicorn ASGI server
- OpenAI API key

### Getting Started
#### 1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
```

#### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
To avoid conflicts with other Python packages on your system, it's recommended to use a virtual environment:
**On macOS/Linux:**
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**On Windows:**
```
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies
You need to provide your OpenAI API key for the backend to communicate with OpenAI's GPT-4 model.
1. Create a file named ```.env``` in the project root.
2. Add the following line to the ```.env``` file:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
```
Replace ```your-openai-api-key-here``` with your actual OpenAI API key.

#### 5. Running the FastAPI Server
Once everything is set up, you can run the FastAPI backend using Uvicorn:
```
uvicorn app:app --reload
```
- ```--reload:``` Automatically reloads the server when code changes are detected.
- The FastAPI server will now be running locally at ```http://127.0.0.1:8000/```

#### 6. Testing the API with Swagger UI
FastAPI provides an interactive API documentation interface called **Swagger UI**, which allows you to test the API directly from your browser.
1. Open your browser and go to:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```
2. Youâ€™ll see a list of API endpoints. For this project, the key endpoint is ```/chat/```, which accepts POST requests to interact with the chatbot.
3. To test the API:
 - Click on ```/chat/```.
 - Enter a sample input in the following format:
    ```
    {
        "user_input": "What is AI?"
    }
    ```
 - Click Execute. You should see the chatbot's response below.

#### API Endpoints
1. **GET /:**
This is a simple health check endpoint. Example:
```
{
  "message": "success"
}
```
2. **POST /chat/:**
This endpoint accepts a user query and returns a response generated by the OpenAI model.
*Request body (JSON format):*
```
{
  "user_input": "What is AI?"
}
```
*Response body:*
```
{
  "response": "AI stands for Artificial Intelligence..."
}
```

#### 7. Stopping the Server
To stop the FastAPI server, press ```CTRL+C``` in the terminal where the server is running.
